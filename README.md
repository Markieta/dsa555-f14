dsa555-f14
==========


This is repo contains class examples for students in DSA555 in fall 2014 at Seneca College.  You can view the examples in the browser, but you can also have a copy of it on your matrix account which will allow you to modify and play with the code.

To get the code contained here on your matrix account:

First time (do this only the first time).  
----------------------------------------

* bring up a unix terminal (matrix, mac terminal, git bash... choice depends on your machine)
* Go to the directory where you would like your code examples for this class to go (if you want it at top level, skip this step)
* type: git clone https://github.com/cathyatseneca/dsa555-f14.git

This will create a directory called dsa555-f14 in your current directory.  Go into that for code updates

All other times (to update after class):
----------------

* Log onto matrix.
* go into the dsa555-f14 directory
* type: git pull origin
